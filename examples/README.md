# Examples

This directory contains examples showcasing how to use HyperGraphs.jl.

## Theoretical examples

These examples can be found in the `theoretical` repository. In `hypergraphs-properties.ipynb` we focus on generating hypergraphs with certain desired properties; so far we demonstrate how to generate a hypergraph with a given degree distribution. We also show how to generate random hypergraphs in `random-hypergraphs.ipynb`.

## Biochemical examples

These examples can be found in the `biochemical` repository. So far, we focus on using chemical hypergraphs to describe biochemical systems.
